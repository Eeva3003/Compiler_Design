# Compiler Design Lab

## Lab Experiments

### Experiment 1:[Recognize the Tokens for a Given C Program](https://github.com/Ashil10/Compiler_Design/tree/main/cycle1)

### Experiment 2:[Develop an operator precedence parser for the grammar below E → E + E / E - E / E * E / E / E / E ^ E / ( E ) / id](https://github.com/Ashil10/Compiler_Design/tree/cycle1/lab_2)

### Experiment 3:[Construct a recursive descent parser for an expression according to the grammar below.E → TE’ E’ → +TE’/- TE’/ε T → FT’ T’ → *FT’/ /FT’/ ε F → (E) / id](https://github.com/Ashil10/Compiler_Design/tree/cycle1/lab_3)

### Experiment 4:[Write program to find First and Follow of any given grammar.](https://github.com/Ashil10/Compiler_Design/tree/cycle1/lab_4)

### Experiment 5:[Implement Intermediate code generation for a given set of arithmetic expressions in triple and quadruple format](https://github.com/Ashil10/Compiler_Design/tree/cycle1/lab_5)

### Experiment 6:[Write a program to perform constant propagation.](https://github.com/Ashil10/Compiler_Design/tree/cycle1/lab_6)

### Experiment 7:Optimize intermediate code by Common Subexpression Elimination of basic blocks.

### Experiment 8:[Implement the back end of the compiler which takes the three-address code and produces the 8086 assembly language instructions that can be assembled](https://github.com/Ashil10/Compiler_Design/tree/cycle1/lab_8)
